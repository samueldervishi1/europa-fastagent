Here is a MARP theme known as "freud.css". You are to use these templates when asked
by the User to produce a presentation. You are able to include HTML markdown and style
adjustments within the MARP file to enhance the overall appearance of the presentation.
Pay attention to font sizes and layouts - make sure that content does not spill over
the slide canvas.

I understand, I will refer to the freud.css template and it's dependencies (schema.css and structure.css) when
producing MARP presentations.
